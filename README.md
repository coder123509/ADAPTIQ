ADAPTIQ: AI-Powered Adaptive Learning System
Overview

ADAPTIQ is an AI-powered personalized learning platform designed to help students develop a strong conceptual foundation by continuously adapting to their learning needs. The system focuses on identifying knowledge gaps and systematically backtracking to fundamental prerequisites before progressing to advanced topics.

Currently tailored for Grade 9 and 10 Physics (NCERT syllabus), ADAPTIQ ensures that students gain an in-depth understanding of core principles by reinforcing the necessary foundational knowledge before moving forward.

Key Features

🔹 Adaptive Learning Path – The system dynamically adjusts the learning path based on a student's performance, ensuring mastery of prerequisite topics before advancing.
🔹 AI-Generated Assessments – ADAPTIQ generates personalized questions based on a structured topic tree, evaluating the student’s grasp of the subject.
🔹 Backtracking Mechanism – If a student struggles with a question, the system identifies and redirects them to fundamental prerequisite topics, ensuring conceptual clarity before revisiting the main topic.
🔹 Real-Time Feedback – Provides instant, AI-driven explanations and recommendations to help students understand their mistakes and improve learning retention.
🔹 Structured Topic Tree – The curriculum is stored in a nested JSON format, where each chapter contains a hierarchy of subtopics and dependencies, allowing for a logical progression of learning.

How It Works

Student attempts a question – AI generates a question based on the current topic.
Correct answer → Moves to the next topic.
Incorrect answer → The system provides feedback.
If the topic has prerequisite concepts, it backtracks to test and reinforce those before returning to the original topic.
If no prerequisite exists, it re-explains the concept and provides additional resources.

Why ADAPTIQ?
✅ Strengthens conceptual understanding – Students develop a solid grasp of fundamental concepts before tackling advanced topics.
✅ Personalized learning experience – AI adapts to each student’s learning pace and needs.
✅ Encourages real-world application – By reinforcing strong foundations, students can apply their knowledge more effectively in practical and competitive scenarios.
