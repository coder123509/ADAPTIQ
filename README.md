# ADAPTIQ

This project leverages the capabilities of AI to design a self-learning dynamic and adpative curriculum, bridging the gaps and laying a solid foundation of core concepts for students.
The main objective of this project is to make sure students get an in-depth understanding of the concepts they lack understanding, or are struggling to cope up with, so that they can introspect and put streamlined efforts 
to make sure they become conceptually strong and get a solid foundation of a particular topic, encouraging them to apply them in real-life scenarios as well.
